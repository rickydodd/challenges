# About
- Collection of challenges I have solved.
- Only solved challenges are pushed.
- My solutions are (currently) all in C.
- Each challenge has a directory, and each directory has a README file with a hyperlink to the respective problem statement.

## Further
### Why C?
My experience with C is smaller than I would like, so I want to practice it some more. In doing so, I also want to practice approaching difficult problems with a low-level mindset.
