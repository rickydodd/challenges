## Further
### Why This Problem?
I wanted a nice ice-breaker for this new repository. Something relatively simple, but not completely trivial (i.e., at least one edge case and requiring at least one data structure beyond primitive types).

### Any Difficulties?
I found the I/O the most difficult part of this, honestly. With particular (really, exclusive) emphasis on the input aspect. I am out of practice with C, and even the practice I have had with it has been superficial. It's part of the reason that I chose C for these challenges: to get better at C and get better low-level problem solving skills.
